# Credit Card Fraud Detection
- Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.
- Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.
- Evaluate the model' s performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or undersampling for improving results.

# Overview
- Identify fraudulent transactions using machine learning algorithms.
- Logistic Regression & XGBoost Classifier
